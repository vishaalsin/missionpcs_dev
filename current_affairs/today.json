The watershed judgment is in spite of the multitude of evidence in the form of visuals, news reports, speeches and even verbal testimonials about the involvement of  those acquitted in the demolition. The verdict comes at an inopportune time as the halting of Amnesty International\u2019s activities, which has focused global attention on the country. It is quite disconcerting as the secular credentials that India has upheld since Independence have been subjected to the opprobrium of the international media.Jacob J. Puthenveettil,ThiruvanathapuramIndia\u2019s virus \u2018peak\u2019 The writers of the article, \u201cImperatives after India\u2019s September virus peak\u201d (Editorial page, September 29),  claim that the country has reached the peak of the epidemic curve, but this assertion is based on a flawed assumption. Observing the currently decreasing trend of average daily reported cases of 85,156 (September 19-25) from the figure of 91,801 (during the fortnight of September 5-18) is  good news, but suffers some faults in modelling. The faults lie in the: assumption of the COVID-19 positive or silently infected population to be around 480-600 million based on the ICMR Survey Round-1 (May 11-June 4); the sero-positivity rate of 0.73%, whereby it is inferred that for every RT-PCR positive case there were 82-130 undocumented infections. When we apply this correction factor \u2014 as the writers rightly did \u2014 we have already reached a figure of above 35% of India\u2019s total population. But the ICMR, just a day after the article, published a revised sero-positivity rate of 6.6% in Round-2 (August 17-September 22) of the result released recently. Thereby, the community-level of infection is only 26-32 infections per reported cases, say 30 times that which is lab confirmed. This will reduce the presumed hidden community infection to 192 million (30% of 1,380 million, which is the total population of India) \u2014 way behind the 414 million minimum level of the population which needs to be infected for herd immunity. This must be an eye-opener. But let us not have unrealistic consolation. We still have densely populated mosaics all over the country where the virus  has not reached. When will it reach and explode after the \u2018Unlocking\u2019 steps we cannot predict if we apply maturity of wisdom rather than relying  on partially-known epidemiology. Dr. Antony K.R.,KochiS.P. BalasubrahmanyamS.P. Balasubrahmanyam is certainly a  great and popular film playback singer. If Lata Mangeshkar can be conferred with the  Bharat Ratna, so can even K.J. Yesudas and SPB. There are other greats such as  M.S. Viswanathan, T.M. Soundararajan and even Illaiyaraja to name a few who too can be considered.  Dr. Balamuralikrishna shone like a beacon in classical Carnatic music and the celluloid world. He was a great popular  singer,  innovator par excellence and composer par excellence. When alive, his fans wished the award to be  conferred on him, but this does not seem to have  reached the ears of those in the hierarchy who decide the awards. It is meaningful to show recognition  when the person is  alive and well. V.P. Dhananjayan,Chennai"},

Some detritus was still left, though: a belief among many that justice would be done and the Constitution and the rule of law would be upheld if the criminal court punishes those who plotted the events of December 6, 1992. Even when the Supreme Court handed over the empty site to those who wanted the mosque brought down to build a Ram temple, its recognition of the demolition as an \u201cegregious violation of the rule of law\u201d gave rise to hope that the ends of justice would be served by the punishment of those who mobilised the vandals. A Special CBI Court in Lucknow has now cleared the remaining debris with an unconscionable judgment. Throwing to the winds the Supreme Court\u2019s observations on the demolition, the trial court has in effect given judicial legitimation to the \u2018Ram Janmabhoomi movement\u2019 by acquitting all those indicted for conspiracy to bring down the structure. Its conclusions are drastic and defy logic and fact. The court\u2019s finding that the demolition was not planned in advance flies in the face of the entry of more than a hundred thousand volunteers into Ayodhya that day, armed with crowbars, spades, hoes and ropes and every implement needed to bring down a sturdy structure and clear the site. The proponents of the movement, headed by L.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti among others, had positioned themselves in vantage points to witness the occasion and celebrate with pride what ought to have caused shame and disgust.It is indeed true that it is not easy to prove a conspiracy, as it essentially takes place in secret. This is where courts must draw reasonable inferences from the circumstances. But in a conspiracy of this nature, it is easy to see that those involved were \u201cmarching under a banner\u201d, an image the Supreme Court had once referred to while explaining the ingredients of a conspiracy. In this case, apart from the political mobilisation and the purported intent to assemble on a particular day, the court had with it sufficient evidence that there was studied inaction on the part of the State, whose Chief Minister was one of the accused, and the unambiguous and open threats to the structure voiced by many of the movement\u2019s protagonists. The dissembling Kalyan Singh, as Chief Minister then, had given what, in hindsight, was an obviously false assurance to the highest court and the National Integration Council that nothing but a symbolic \u2018kar seva\u2019 would take place. Specific instructions appeared to have been given to the security forces not to stop the \u2018kar sevaks\u2019 or hinder their plans. How else would one explain the events? When the crowd went into a frenzy, goaded on by provocative speeches by the dignitaries, and vandals went up the dome, the accused would have the court believe that they were actually trying to restrain the mob and prevent the demolition! The possibility of tampered audio and video evidence or even disavowals on record would not undo the cumulative effect of the logistical and financial preparation, besides the communal mobilisation. Mr. Advani, who had then claimed it was the saddest day of his life, now says the en masse acquittal is a vindication of the movement. This  indicates that the objective of the mobilisation, exemplified by his rath yatra, was always to alter the status quo with violence.The Manmohan Singh Liberhan Commission had laid bare the entire conspiracy in its damning report, but unfortunately, a probe under the Commission of Inquiry Act has no binding value, whereas the evidence adduced at the trial alone matters. It is, of course, the responsibility of the CBI to prove the element of conspiracy, the details of the advance mobilisation, the \u201cmeeting of minds\u201d that is required to prove a plot and its broad contours. That the agency failed is no surprise. From the beginning, the police investigation has been marked by bungling. When the main events were covered by two FIRs, the U.P. government initially failed to notify both of them while designating courts for trial. The Allahabad High Court quashed the flawed notification, and the State government\u2019s failure to rectify the irregularity resulted in separate proceedings in Lucknow and Rae Bareilly.  The CBI, instead of challenging the State\u2019s rejection of its request for curing a technical defect, filed a supplementary charge sheet after omitting the \u2018conspiracy\u2019 charge. The Supreme Court later said this derailed the joint trial and resulted in separate proceedings in two places. In 2017, the Supreme Court revived the conspiracy charge, directed the trial court to resume day-to-day trial and sternly reminded the agency that it was because of its failure and that of the State government that a crime that shook the  secular fabric of the Constitution had not seen justice for 25 years. Whether a politically hamstrung agency could have successfully prosecuted such a sensitive case is a moot question. But the results are there for all to see.Even allowing for the possibility that the judiciary is in  close alignment with the executive, it is unacceptable to see a court going so far as to parrot the specious theory advanced by the demolition squad from the BJP-VHP-RSS family for years that the destruction was a \u201cspontaneous act\u201d. All those who went through that disgraceful phase in India\u2019s  political history  know that the demolition was only the culmination of a revanchist movement. The period was marked by communal mobilisation, holding of processions to gather \u2018bricks\u2019 meant for constructing a  temple, and an attempt to storm the site in 1990, which ended in bloodshed. Given this grisly background, and the grave implications that the exoneration of those who demolished a religious structure would have on public trust in the judicial system, it is imperative that the CBI goes  on appeal. The cause of communal amity cannot afford successive judicial setbacks to both secular values and the rule of law."},

The analogy of the cloud that absorbs ocean water and distributes it as pure drinking water for sustenance is often quoted to show how the Divya Prabandha hymns bring the very essence of the esoteric truths of the scriptures in simple Tamil language to the common man. More importantly, each of the Azhwars, being inspired by the Lord Himself, has sung hymns that sensitise the common man to rise to the level of pure devotional experience, which is after all the aim and end of bhakti yoga, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. Among the Azhwars, Kulasekhara Azhwar has many specials to his credit. There is a karna parampara story that shows this Azhwar\u2019s association with the three foremost Vaishnava Divya Desams, Sri Vaikunta, Tiruparkadal and Srirangam. It is believed that the Lord gave darshan to Kulasekhara and instilled bhakti in him directly when He had instructed Vishvaksena to bring him to Vaikunta.Tiruparkadal happens to be the source of his emergence since he is believed to be the incarnation of the Lord\u2019s Kaustuba gem that was obtained during the churning of the milky ocean. His penchant for Srirangam Kshetra is well known and in his magnum opus Perumal Tirumozhi, acclaimed for its poetic beauty and devotional fervour, he pours out his heart and his love for the Lord in moving terms. In addition, he is the only Azhwar who has composed a hymn in Sanskrit, the Mukunda Mala Stotra. Ramanuja has composed a taniyan in honour of this Azhwar and in it he extols the unique ways in which the Azhwar exemplifies both Bhagavad bhakti and Bhagavata bhakti. "},

The judge said the interviews of the accused and statements published in newspapers and submitted by the CBI from November 1990 to May 1993 could not be considered as evidence. \u2018All was normal\u2019The court said that it had also been established that on December 6, 1992 around 12 p.m. everything was normal, but when senior VHP leader Ashok Singhal announced again how the kar seva should proceed, a \u201csection of kar sevaks\u201d became agitated and started pelting the mosque with stones. Some broke the barricades and climbed the structure, following which Singhal asked the group of kar sevaks to return, but they instead started attacking him, noted the court.\u201c ... they were definitely hooligans, because if they were actual believers of Lord Ram, they would have paid heed to Ashok Singhal\u2019s statement that the disputed structure \u2018is also a temple and you have to protect it\u2019,\u201d said the court. CBI lawyers said it was up to the CBI headquarters to decide on filing an appeal. Any of the aggrieved parties \u2014 there were 49 FIRs filed in this case \u2014 could also go for appeal, said a lawyer."},

And there wasn\u2019t another great chase from Rajasthan Royals.Kolkata Knight Riders brought Royals, who had won both their games in Sharjah, crashing down to earth at the Dubai International Stadium on Wednesday, winning their IPL encounter by 37 runs.Responding to Knight Riders\u2019 174 for six, Royals finished with 137 for nine.Steve Smith, who didn\u2019t look as composed as he did in his last two outings, tried to hit  Pat Cummins high and far down the leg-side, but only managed to edge it to rival captain Dinesh Karthik. His dismissal brought to the wicket the other in-form Royals batsman, Samson.Shivam Mavi, after bowling a tight first over, ensured that the dasher from Kerala would not make it a hat-trick of awards. Samson failed to time his pull and ended up giving a comfortable catch to Sunil Narine at mid-wicket.The 21-year-old from Uttar Pradesh wasn\u2019t done yet. In his next over, he took one of the most prized wickets in white-ball cricket. Jos Buttler went for a slash off a wider ball and was taken at short third man by Varun Chakravarthy. Kamlesh Nagarkoti, another young pacer from India\u2019s under-19 World Cup-winning team in 2018, took over from Mavi. He dismissed Robin Uthappa and Riyan Parag cheaply to reduce Royals to 42 for five.The stage was now set for the man-of-the-moment, Tewatia. But he lasted only 10 balls, his middle-stump uprooted by mystery-spinner Varun. Now, somebody else had to do a Tewatia \u2014 and more \u2014 if Royals had to pull off another incredible chase. Nobody could manage it, although Tom Curran (54 n.o., 36b, 2x4, 3x6) tried.Earlier, an assured innings at the top of the order from Shubman Gill (47, 34b, 5x4, 1x6), and a calculated assault towards the end by Eoin Morgan (34 not out, 23b, 1x4, 2x6) got Kolkata to a total it could defend. That was after Jofra Archer had threatened to restrict the side to far less.The England quick came up with a superb spell. He bowled with express pace and was used well by Smith.

In the Asia-Pacific region, these impacts are particularly acute, adding to the challenge of grappling with accelerating population ageing. Women, who generally outlive men,  constitute the majority of older persons in the region, but represent an even greater majority of the \u2018oldest old\u2019 population of 80 years and over.A vulnerable category of peopleEven before the COVID-19 crisis, elderly women in a majority of Asia-Pacific countries were facing significant challenges, exacerbated by the fact that many societies have been moving from traditional, nuclear family-oriented patterns to far more fluid, fragmented structures. The result has been that many older women, with a higher tendency to live alone, face poverty and are more likely to lack family and other socioeconomic support. The majority of older people do not have reliable and sustained access to a caregiver. Facing non-existent or only minimal safety nets, many have already slid into poverty during the pandemic or are on the cusp of doing so.The pandemic has brought into focus the urgent need for both governments and civil society to address the complex demographic shift of population ageing, with strategic solutions. To do so successfully, we need a life cycle approach to healthy ageing, with particular emphasis on girls and women, firmly grounded in gender equality and human rights.To unpack this, let us consider a woman in her 70s in the small village where she was born and raised. As with so many of her generation, she was made to marry early, with minimum education. She had children early, pregnancies were unplanned, childbirth was risky. Her husband, many years older, died a  while ago, leaving her a widow, unprepared to enter the workforce or properly fend for herself. Her children left the village for the city, adding to her isolation. This is the scenario many older women now face, with the added risks and effects of COVID-19. But imagine if, as an adolescent, this woman had been able to complete  higher education; achieve gainful employment; marry as an adult and of her own choice; have healthy children and invest in their well-being; and enjoy a secure old age.Plans in placeIf there are better policies, more resilient social systems and gender equality, the lives of older people, especially women, can be improved significantly. This would also allow societies to harness the valuable experiences  of older persons as they age. In fact, the commitment to advance a better world in an ageing society has already been articulated by the 2002 Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. This agreement commends the development of evidence-based policies that help create \u201ca society for all ages\u201d. In addition, the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals underscore the basis of this approach to healthy ageing.We must collectively prioritise greater action, funding and implementation. Our mandate in the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) incorporates the need to enable and strengthen the self-reliance of older persons. The ICPD Programme of Action is our foundation, and our guiding principle. UNFPA is committed to helping governments in full partnership with civil society and communities. This is the Decade of Healthy Ageing as well as the Decade of Action to achieve the SDGs. As Asia-Pacific, with the rest of the world, seeks to \u2018build back better\u2019 from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, let us seize this moment to transform the challenge of population ageing into an opportunity.

The challenge is that the onus of altering health behaviour lies with the individuals who often don\u2019t have the option of changing their livelihood. We see this during this pandemic. This demonstrates the failure of public health in internalising the knowledge about the social origins of human behaviour. Let\u2019s examine four aspects of our response to COVID-19. Identifying \u2018at risk\u2019 sections The real skill of public health professionals during an epidemic is to identify those social groups which can be at greater risk to disease at any given point of time. The screening of those groups becomes efficient when the high-risk groups are identified and targeted for systematic surveillance to prevent potential spread of a disease. In other words, the real skill of public health surveillance is to pick up those who are at risk from a general population, even before they know that they are at risk. To know whether any group is at risk or not is possible only if we have a deep understanding of the society and its people and their livelihood-related behaviour of which health behaviour forms a part. It is this classic public health act of identifying an \u2018at risk\u2019 population that calls for an anthropological understanding of human lives for which understanding risky health behaviour becomes inevitable. Laboratory tests only categorise the population as \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019. These can be matched with those with risky health behaviour and non-risky health behaviour. These categories are further linked to their livelihood characteristics and are crucial for effective public health action. Any attempt to over-emphasise laboratory tests during an epidemic without capturing the health behaviour of people is actually putting the cart before the horse. This is what happens when very little is known about people, their occupation and health behaviour. Another related but crucial aspect of health behaviour is the significant linkage it has with the prevention of an epidemic. The primary purpose of public health action during an epidemic is to prevent the spread of a disease in the community. When laboratory tests that are meant for clinical practice become the starting point, and when guidelines state that only those with symptoms be tested, this does not help prevent the spread of the disease. This is because testing is done among those who already have symptoms and who have the potential to transmit the disease to others by the time test results are available. The overreliance on laboratory tests not only means that we lose the opportunity to detect those who are possibly at high risk of transmission but also the opportunity to look for high risk behaviour among people. In other words, the approach to tackle COVID-19 allows, by design, silent transmission of the disease within populations. Capacity to modify behaviour The third important aspect is the the role of health awareness in health behaviour. Many who are at risk find it difficult to modify their health behaviour despite being aware that they are at risk. People are aware that taking precautions like wearing masks, hand washing and maintaining physical distancing can prevent transmission of the disease. Yet we hear of politicians, celebrities, healthcare workers and those travelling in public transport testing positive for COVID-19. This implies that there is a limit to an individual\u2019s capacity to modify his behaviour and sustain that behaviour without altering his living and working condition. Related to this is the fact that if there is success in controlling an epidemic, the credit goes to science and institutions and the government, whereas if there is a failure to control the epidemic, the blame is placed on the people. There is a failure to understand that health behaviour is only a subset of human behaviour and is closely linked to a person\u2019s living and working conditions. Behavourial change takes place when society is organised in such a way that there is no option to engage in risky/ unhealthy behaviour by virtue of one\u2019s occupation or social position. Right now, those who can afford to modify their life conditions without affecting their livelihood are the ones who are mostly able to keep away from the risk of COVID-19. Finally, it is important to examine ways by which States/ governments intervene to ensure that people follow a certain health behaviour. Most States invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 and some gave the police the responsibility to ensure that people follow certain health behaviour. What is the expectation of public health professionals about people\u2019s health behaviour during epidemics? Can we expect people to recognise the potential risks on their own and keep away from those risks? Disease control models focus on modifying individual risk factors. The role of public health in this case gets largely confined to \u2018preaching\u2019 with very little scope for action. The second approach has been to create fear of punishment as the basis of behavioural change. The police is given the responsibility to fine people when they violate rules. This has serious ethical implications, especially for those who cannot afford certain health behavioural practices. What history teaches us is that those health behavioural practices that are \u2018natural\u2019 and linked to living and working conditions are more acceptable and sustainable and are followed by people voluntarily. The task of public health professionals is to understand those health behavioural practices and the relationship of those practices with social structures and institutions. Anything short of this commitment in public health will ultimately result in putting the onus on the people to adopt \u2018self-control\u2019 which is the same as \u2018preaching\u2019, where there is little scope for action. For real changeHealth behaviour plays a critical role in deciding the success of any public health intervention. The potential of health behaviour to transform the direction of any crisis is immense. The real change in health behaviour is possible only when there is acknowledgement of its societal roots and there are efforts to alter it at multiple levels. Instead, putting the onus of changing or modifying health behaviour onto individuals will only result in \u2018victim blaming\u2019 and create distrust between people and those responsible for epidemic control.

Malay had evolved due to the need in maritime Southeast Asia for a lingua franca for trade and other exchanges. In this region, hundreds of languages were spoken across thousands of islands that now comprise the modern nations of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. As it was grammatically simple, non-hierarchical, and easier to learn than other regional languages, Malay became an accepted language of communication. Bahasa Indonesia aimed to bring more than 300 ethnic groups together with no one ethnic group, including the Javanese, overshadowing the rest. From the outset of its independence, Indonesia recognised the importance of avoiding the inequality that was likely to occur by imposing the language of one dominant ethnic group over others. Debates in the Constituent Assembly In contrast, the issue of adopting a national language could not be resolved when the Constituent Assembly began drafting India\u2019s Constitution. The adoption of a national language, the language in which the Constitution was to be written, and the language in which the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly were to be conducted were the main questions  debated. On the one side were members from the Hindi-speaking provinces who moved a  number of pro-Hindi amendments and argued for adopting Hindi as the sole national language. One of the drafters declared, \u201cPeople who do not know Hindustani have no right to stay in India. People who are present in the House to fashion a constitution... and do not know Hindi are not worthy to be members of this Assembly.\u201d A member of the Assembly from the south said, \u201cIf we are going to be compelled to learn Hindi... I would perhaps not be able to do it at my age, and perhaps I would not be willing...  because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need... will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language of the Centre.\u201dWidespread resistance to the imposition of Hindi on non-native speakers, especially in Tamil Nadu, led to the passage of the Official Languages Act of 1963, which provided for the continued use of English  for all official purposes. Hindi became the sole working language of the Union government by 1965 with the State governments free to function in the language of their choice. Meanwhile, the constitutional directive for the Union government to encourage the spread of Hindi  was retained within Central government entities in non-Hindi-speaking States.Later, Hindi speakers from the IT, construction and other sectors began moving for jobs to the south where many languages and dialects are spoken. Despite this migration to States that speak other languages, the Census found that while Hindi is the fastest growing language, the number of speakers of  other languages has dropped. In Tamil Nadu, for example, over a 10-year period, the number of Tamil speakers of Hindi doubled largely because Tamilians needed to converse with those who came from the north.Loss of a language and a way of lifeAccording to the 2001 Census, India has 30 languages that are spoken by more than a million people each. The Constitution lists 22 languages and protects them in the eighth schedule. Many languages are kept out of this schedule even if they deserve to be included. This includes Tulu which is spoken by over 1.8 million people and has inscriptions dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries. When a refined language loses its status in literary and daily interactions, the way of life associated with it also vanishes.On the other hand, Hindi, a much younger Indo-Aryan language, has been gaining prominence since before independence. Old Hindi assimilated words from Persian. With the arrival of Islamic administrative rule in north India, it became Hindustani. The growing importance of Hindustani in colonial India and the association of Urdu with Muslims prompted Hindus in north India to develop a Sanskritised version, leading to the formation of a modern standard Hindi a century later. It was based on the vernacular of Delhi and the surrounding region and came to replace prestige dialects such as Awadhi, Maithili and Braj. The literary value of these dialects diminished in due course.While discussing Hindi and its use, let us also focus on the merit of other Indian languages. It we don\u2019t protect and promote other well-evolved or endangered and indigenous languages, our future generations may end up never understanding their \u2018real\u2019 roots and culture. Instead of focusing on one national language, why not learn a language beyond one\u2019s mother tongue and get to know a different way of life too?

Jose approached the Kerala High Court on Wednesday challenging the First Information Report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a court here on the alleged irregularities in a  housing project at Wadakkanchery in Thrissur.Mr. Jose said the CBI had registered the FIR with mala fide intentions and it was guided by political and extraneous considerations. The FIR alleged violation of Section 3 of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. In fact, the LIFE Mission had not accepted any contributions, much less foreign contributions. The contractual agreement for the construction of the buildings under the LIFE Mission was executed between the Consular General of the United Arab Emirate and Unitac, a construction company. It was the sponsors that selected Unitac and Sane Ventures. Neither the State government nor the LIFE Mission had any role in the selection of contractors. The companies which inked the agreements with the UAE Consulate General did not come under any category of persons prohibited from receiving foreign contributions under Section 3 of the Act. Mr. Jose said even if it was assumed that they had received contributions or any amount from the Red Crescent, a U.S.-based organisation, no offence could be attributed to them. Besides, amounts received by way of fee or cost in lieu of goods or services rendered in ordinary course would not come under the foreign contributions as per explanation 3 to Section 2(h) of the Act.The CBI now proposed to conduct a roving inquiry against the government officials concerned to find out whether they had committed any offence. In fact, the investigation could only be conducted into an offence already committed as per the Act. The petition sought quashing of the FIR registered on a complaint filed by Anil Akkara, the local Congress MLA."},

For the first time, fiber based on energy intake was recommended and the level of about 40 gm/2000 kcal has been considered as safe intake. For carbohydrates, the EAR has been set at 100 gm/day for ages 1 and above with a RDA of 130 gm/day. With regard to sodium due to emerging concerns on prevalence of hypertension a safe intake of 2000 mg/day which amounts to 5 gm/day of salt is recommended; while an intake of 3,510 mg/day is recommended for potassium.

It used surveillance and contact tracing data from these two States to generate observations that might also work in other similar low- and middle-income settings. The authors of the paper, titled \u2018Epidemiology and Transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in two Indian States\u2019, include the Health Secretaries of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, J. Radhakrishnan and K.S. Jawahar Reddy, Ramanan Laxminarayan of Center for Disease Dynamics, Delhi, and researchers from Princeton Environmental Institute and Center for Computational Biology, University of California, Berkeley. Much of the information about COVID-19 so far has been from China, Europe and the United States (U.S.). \u201cAlthough most COVID-19 cases have occurred in low-resource countries, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease in such contexts. Data from the Indian States of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh provide a detailed view into SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways and mortality in a high-incidence setting,\u201d the paper stated. Both States recorded their first laboratory-confirmed case on March 5 and are among those with the largest public health expenditures per capita. They initiated rigorous disease surveillance early, the researchers said. \u201cOur analysis suggests substantial variation in individuals\u2019 likelihood of transmitting: no secondary infections were linked to 71% of cases whose contacts were traced and tested,\u201d it added. It identified high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of cases around their own age. School closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions during the study period may have contributed to the reductions in contact among children. The analyses of fatal outcomes revealed an overall case-fatality ratio of 2.1%. They averred that a lower relative incidence of COVID-19 among older adults in the two States has contributed to stark differences in the overall case fatality ratio and age distribution of decedents, in comparison to observations in the U.S. and other countries. It also studied the role of super spreaders in transmission."},

This is also the first time since 2010 that India has got more than 100% of its long period average (LPA) of 88 cm in consecutive years. Last year, India saw record rainfall of 110% of the LPA, the highest in a quarter century.India has never got over 105% of the LPA in consecutive years in at least 30 years, according to records available since 1988 on the IMD website.\u201cThese have been an unusually good couple of years for the monsoon,\u201d said D.S. Pai, chief forecaster, National Climate Centre, IMD Pune. \u201cThere are larger trends that statistics show of a decadal swing in overall monsoon rainfall. The last two decades, however, have been weak and hopefully, what we see now is the beginning of a new epoch.\u201dThe heavy rains this year have been due to several long-lasting low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal that fuelled heavy rain over large swathes of India in August. This wiped out the deficit in July, which is usually the rainiest of the four monsoon months. At 32 cm, August rainfall was nearly 26% more than what\u2019s usual for the month.Tad short of excessA developing La Nina, the converse of an El Nino, which is a heating of the central equatorial Pacific and responsible for diminished monsoon rain over India, too, contributed to munificent rain this year. The IMD, in its forecasts, had anticipated \u2018normal\u2019 rain, defined as 96-104% of the LPA. Rains above 110% LPA are termed \u2018excess\u2019 and this year has fallen only a tad short.

Sukhbir Singh Badal, party chief and former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister, says it is sad the BJP was \u2018insensitive\u2019 to the huge relevance of the alliance with his party in Punjab against the backdrop of Hindu-Sikh unity. Excerpts:The SAD-BJP alliance in Punjab was seen as symbol of Sikh-Hindu unity. How do you assess the situation after the breaking of the alliance?The values of peace and communal harmony are very dear to us. Mr. Parkash Singh Badal is a symbol of peace and the basic thing he taught us is that Punjab can progress only if there is peace. Badal sahab\u2019s basic fundamental was that he took every community, every religious organisation together. He took everyone into confidence for everything and that is why everyone trusts him, and that philosophy we will carry on. For us every religion will play equal part in developing Punjab. Punjab is a border State and the Government of India should have been very sensitive. Punjabis and Sikhs are very emotional people. With love, you can take anything from them, but if you do something which hurts them, they get agitated quickly. It is sad that the BJP is insensitive to the huge relevance of our alliance in Punjab for Hindu-Sikh unity. The SAD initially supported agriculture sector ordinances but later decided to alter its stance. The Opposition accuses you of changing your stance only after facing backlash from farmers to save your \u2018vote bank\u2019. We never altered our stand from the beginning. When ordinances came to the Cabinet, we had put forward our objections surrounding them. The ordinances were never discussed with us before the Cabinet meeting. In the meeting, we objected. But we were assured that farmers\u2019 reservations would be addressed when these ordinances are converted into Bills for Parliament. We shared the farmers\u2019 concerns and expected that the BJP would accept all of them, but when they did not accept them, we were left with no choice [but to leave the alliance]. In the past few months, I have always been telling farmers that for us [the SAD], any alliance or Ministry is not as important as farmers. Our aim was to gather farmers\u2019 suggestions, and when I held meetings with farm organisations and farm experts, they shared the apprehension that MSP (minimum support price) would be wiped out [by the farm Bills], among other concerns. I conveyed all the objections to the Government of India and the government gave in writing that they will not discontinue MSP. We then took this message to farmers, but the people of the State, including legal experts, suggested that the assurance in writing was not sufficient. So, all this time, we were conveying what the government said to the farmers, and shared the farmers\u2019 view with the government, because we were a part of the NDA. We were assured that they [the Central government] would listen to us. But when they did not listen, we told them we would oppose [them] and walked out of the government. We always remained on one stand. Were you betrayed by the BJP over the farm laws?The BJP should have consulted its allies first. SAD represents farmers. We know more about farmers than the BJP. In an alliance, numbers should not always be used as the method of taking decisions. Instead, a partnership should be considered as the base for decision-making.The SAD had always been advocating more powers to the States. Against this background do you think the agriculture legislation encroaches on the States\u2019 functions?Yes, absolutely. These laws are a clear encroachment on State functions. Agriculture is a State subject but they [the Centre] got the ordinances through the via media of trading, which falls in the Concurrent List. So, the government used the Concurrent List, which is a wrong way to do [this legislation]. We stand for a federal India. These laws are clearly violating the federal principle.After the agriculture Bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha, you said that democratic virtues had been ignored. Can you elaborate?Winning and losing is something different but the system should not be broken. When people in the Rajya Sabha wanted division of votes on the Bills, it should have taken place. Why were the Bills forced? They [the NDA] would still have had the numbers but you cannot just push your way in the manner in which it was done, by bulldozing all norms. The spirit of democracy is consensus, not majoritarian confrontation. People want consensus and peace. No attempt was made in that direction to bring a consensus in Parliament and the Bills were passed in the Rajya Sabha, flouting all democratic traditions.How do you plan to fight against the new agriculture laws? Will you be approaching other political parties, especially the regional parties, to join hands for the farmers\u2019 cause?We will try to get all farmers\u2019 organisations under one platform, emerge as one force, and raise our concerns with the Centre. We will fight these laws at every level, including in the people\u2019s court. Farmers are facing a crisis of life and death, and the nation must come to their rescue. What is happening is that the government has abandoned farmers in favour of corporates. The fire has spread all across the country. We will approach regional parties in the country and try to get all together on a single platform against the Centre\u2019s agriculture legislations and other farmers\u2019 issues. The Assembly election in Punjab is due in 2022. Do you think the farm legislation will be the key election issue?First let us fight this battle to save our farmers. The ruling Congress government is the most incompetent government that Punjab has ever had. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh is hardly seen in Punjab. He doesn\u2019t meet anybody. "},

She walks from one street to another in the seaside village of Kayalpattinam in Thoothukudi, a basket balanced on her head, singing-announcing fresh puttu. The old woman \u2014 her name is Samudrakani \u2014 was a fixture in Jariya Azeez\u2019s childhood. \u201cShe\u2019s unable to walk long distances now, so doesn\u2019t sell puttu any more,\u201d says Jariya over phone. Twenty-eight-year-old Jariya, who was raised in Chennai, is from Kayalpattinam. She runs Abati, a store that focusses on sustainable and handmade products, from her ancestral home in the town. During the course of curating products for her venture, she came across palm-based edibles such as puttu, paavu, and pudisakkaram. \u201cThese are locally produced and are popular in a few other villages around Kayalpattinam as well,\u201d she explains. Made by families who have been in the business for generations, they are sold in small quantities in the villages during summer. \u201cBut these delicacies have been confined to our region; not many people  outside are aware of them,\u201d points out Jariya.Which is why during lockdown, she decided to document the making of these desserts. She met and interviewed families involved. \u201cPuttu,\u201d explains Jariya, \u201cIs available for six months a year. In Kayalpattinam, there are a handful of families making it. The men head out early in the day to climb palm trees and bring down padhaneer (palm sap).\u201d The preparation is mostly done by the women in the family. They empty fermented palm sap into huge cauldrons and stir them over a wood-fired stove until it takes on a golden colour. \u201cThen the flavouring is added: this can be mango, dry ginger, moong dal, sesame seeds, coconut, or cashews,\u201d says Jariya. This concoction is then poured into moulds and let to harden. So puttu, in essence, is flavoured palm jaggery. \u201cTo make paavu, the women continue to stir the same mixture until it takes on a thick, fudge-like consistency,\u201d she adds. \u201cRice flour is added to this mixture to make pidisakkaram that derives its name from \u2018pidi\u2019, meaning, to shape by hand.\u201d Jariya laughs as she recalls how her great grandmother stored the jaggery in earthen pots, hung high up from the ceiling, out of reach of children. Today, if you visit Kayalpattinam or its neighbouring villages in the summer months, you can buy flavoured jaggery by the kilo. \u201cBut these days, though, the women make them only in small batches as per demand.\u201d Jariya, with help from Mohideen MSL and Mubarak VMH, both college students from the town, and Ahamed Mujahidha, a local, is making a documentary film on the process. \u201cI remember how in the past, women from our village would walk to nearby Poonthottam, where paavu was made every summer. They carried coconut, fruits, and vegetables of their choice and handed them over to the paavu makers, waited until it was done and brought the dish back home,\u201d she recalls. These days, though, this practice has become a thing of the past. \u201cThese are signs that this craft is dying, and we wanted to document it to showcase this to our future generations and the outside world,\u201d explains Jariya.This summer, Jariya even sold the desserts on her Instagram page. In a hand-woven palm box, she packaged 50 grams each of five different flavours of the jaggery in small, colourful palm leaf pouches; a box of paavu; a multi-millet mix; and a sweet seeni maavu made of rice flour and coconut milk. \u201cI wanted to share what Kayalpattinam had to offer with everyone else; we take pride in what we make and designed this assortment as an alternative to a box of chocolates,\u201d she adds. The jaggery and the seeni maavu can be incorporated into breakfast. \u201cThey can be added as topping to a lot of dishes, had with tea...paavu can be used like jam.\u201d\u2018Puttu paati\u2019 Samudrakani, meanwhile, despite not stepping out for work, is hale and healthy. Jariya and team met her recently for their documentary. She even posed for a photo with them, sporting dark glasses. For details, visit https://www.instagram.com/46thaikastreet/. "},

Round and round she moves, twirling her arched legs around it as if cutting through water. In a one handed motion, she inverts herself until her hair falls away from her face, striking a graceful pose to the music of violins from the late SP Balasubrahmanyam\u2019s \u2018Thoda Thoda\u2019.\u201cAsk people what superpower they would want to have, and most would say flying,\u201d says 29-year-old Anusha. Chasing after this freeing sensation, the multi-hyphenate choreographer who has worked for movies such as Maryan  and Shuddh Desi Romance, has found her latest passion \u2014 pole art. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the pole, it feels like you are flying. But at the same time, you are in complete control of your body. If you\u2019re not in control, you will fall, so it keeps you at a higher level of consciousness.\u201dAfter just one class in Melbourne last year, on an introduction to pole art, Anusha had a pole installed in her Chennai home in March this year. \u201cA friend of mine ordered it from the US and we self assembled it. I don\u2019t think there are companies here who do that,\u201d she says. Since then, she has been putting out videos of her pole dances on Instagram every few days, garnering over 73K views on her latest one. The songs of her choice include classics like Sid Sriram\u2019s \u2018Ennadi Mayavi Nee\u2019 and Hariharan\u2019s \u2018Pachai Nirame\u2019 \u2014 those that bring melody and rhythm to the pole and make her movements look soft and powerful at the same time. There is a bigger reason behind the selection of these songs, she explains, \u201cThe pole fitness community abroad is huge. They take it as seriously as we take Classical dance. But here pole dance is associated with eroticism. Like, if you\u2019re on a pole, you\u2019re a stripper.\u201d With these well-loved songs, she hopes to break the art form free from that idea and earn respect for the strength it requires.\u201cPole dancing needs full body strength: upper body to pull yourself up against gravity, core to hold on to the pole without using your arms, and lower body to perform mid-air inversions. So it is a combination of strength, flexibility and endurance,\u201d she says. Anusha recalls how she would practise day in and out when she first got the pole, resulting in a shoulder injury. \u201cMy trainers sat me down and made me realise that I was trying to get the  perfection of Day 1,000, on Day 1. So after that, I started taking it step by step. They moulded my fitness training around the pole, working on my hip strength, core ability and pull-ups.\u201dWith this level of fitness also comes a confidence boost \u2014 \u201cit makes you feel powerful, every time you unlock the next feat or trick,\u201d says Anusha. This is why, by next year she hopes to start a community of pole artists in South India, as Indian pole artists are far and few in between.\u201cThe pole is for everybody but for women especially, I think it\u2019s a great way to interact with each other,\u201d she says, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have survived the lockdown if not for the pole.\u201d"},

She just clucks and goes about her life, laying an egg a  day. The now seven-year-old, met Guirec Soud\u00e9e when he had docked at Tenerife in the Canary Islands, during the course of his world cruise. He adopted the six-month-old hen and they have been inseparable  since. As a 20-year-old, Guirec set off on what he calls his \u201cdream journey\u201d in 2013. His choice of transport: a rusty, motorised fishing boat with a small diesel engine for manoeuvres in ports, or to escape the current when there is no wind. He named it Yvinec, after the French island that is his home. The sailing expedition took him five years to complete. He received a hero\u2019s welcome when he returned. Though, he admits, it was hard to come back and not find his father at home. \u201cHe passed away while I was on the high seas,\u201d he says. Since then Guirec has become a local celebrity with three books (The Hen Who Sailed The World, Le Monde Selon Guirec et Monique and La Fabuleuse Histoire de Guirec et Monique) to his credit as well as a 60-minute documentary titled Du P\u00f4ule Nord au P\u00f4ule Sud. \u201cWe started the theatre tour with it in France in January this year and received more than 10,000 spectators. But due to the pandemic, we had to cancel everything.\u201d Last week, the documentary was screened at Le Grand Rex, one of the biggest theatres in Paris. (With physical distancing, they could accommodate only an audience of 1,700.) For now, the 28-year-old is more than happy to recount his adventure over an email interview onboard  Yvinec. \u201cI first crossed the Atlantic leaving France from Brittany, stopped by Spain, Portugal, Madeira, Canary Islands then straight to the Caribbean,\u201d says Guirec, explaining his route. At the Caribbean, he worked for a year to get his boat ready for ice, as he headed North through Canada, Saint Pierre and Miquelon islands, on to Greenland. \u201cAfter wintering in autarky in the ice, I sailed through the Northwest Passage under the Arctic Circle, and became the youngest sailor to cross it without any assistance,\u201d he says. Next stop, Alaska, followed by San Francisco, before setting sail on a long stretch through Cape Horn, Antarctica, South Africa, Brazil, French Guiana, the Caribbean again and back to France. Monique, meanwhile, had no problems with the swinging of the boat and was out and about most of the time. \u201cShe loves fish and soon become very good at catching the flying fish on the deck,\u201d says Guirec. The rest of the day for Monique was spent at leisure as she sat back taking in the scenes and watching her friend do all the hard work.Throughout the voyage the two spent the nights on Guirec\u2019s boat, except in Canada, where the hull needed to be fixed. Guirec never planned how long he would dock at each city. But he was keen on spending a few months, at Saqqaq in Greenland. \u201cThe plan was to spend the Arctic winter trapped in the ice. By that I mean, the boat stuck in the ice. I chose a remote bay and dropped anchor waiting for the ice floe to form around the hull,\u201d he says. He had also willingly planned to be cut off from civilisation with no food other than some rice, no communication or connection with anybody. The temperature was -60 degree Celsius and most of the time was spent inside the cabin on board.\u201cI spent four months like that with Monique,\u201d says Guirec. Fortunately for him, Monique laid eggs the entire time. It was hard to source food and his fishing through the ice did not quite work out. He was told that a stressed hen would not give eggs. But given this globetrotting hen\u2019s record, she seemed far from stressed. \u201cShe is a special chick,\u201d he says.As he travelled, he paused at port cities to make money: fixing boats, giving kite-surfing lessons, cleaning swimming pools and working at nautical beach schools.

He is overwhelmed by the response to their maiden online show \u2018Life in a Circus: Save the Circus\u2019 that was held on September 25.Last week, in an innovation triggered by the pandemic, Rambo Circus went virtual. A month before this digital show, a fully made-up Biju, performed in an empty big top for the first time along with 30 other artistes in a one-hour scripted, directed show. \u2018Life is a Circus\u2019, relayed eight times over the weekend, was a sell out. Biju has been the clown at Rambo Circus for 21 years and was  hoping to represent India at the Monte Carlo International Circus Festival this year. However, COVID-19 led to the cancellation of the festival as well as the first leg of Rambo Circus\u2019 scheduled launch at Airoli in Navi Mumbai. \u201cWe had put up the big tent and our artistes were getting ready. We were stranded there with 100 artistes from different parts of India. With the help of the local police and corporators, we managed to send 40 people back but the others had to be looked after,\u201d says Sujith Dilip, one of the proprietors of the Pune-based circus company.Dinesh Shetty of Production Crew and Navneeth Mohan and Saurab Khurana of LaQshya Live Experiences came up with the idea of a digital circus. \u201cWe were figuring out ways to help artistes and get entertainment going. We thought of the circus, which was scheduled to come to town,\u201d says Navneeth, adding: \u201cThe circus is already a dying art form and the present generation  do not  know how much fun it is. We wanted to bring it to them in these times of isolation.\u201dDinesh discussed the concept with the artistes, explaining the alterations required for a digital show. Dance choreographer Rahul Saxena choreographed the show and Vipul Roy narrated the story of the pandemic-affected circus.The tent with a capacity to host an audience of 1,200 was put up with the help of 30 artistes and supporting staff. Dinesh says that help from industry vendors poured in. \u201cAs it was not a live show, we had to amp up the effects,\u201d he says. After a week of diligent rehearsals, the final show was staged. When the lights came on, a gamut of aerial acts, ladder balance, juggling feats, clown comedy and more unfolded. Some popular acts were missing either because of the manpower needed for big equipment or because the artists had gone home.  But for Rambo Circus, this was a watershed moment. "},

I hadn\u2019t expected to hear the shrill, loud disyllabic \u2018chee-wee\u2019 cry of the Greenish Warbler, in a stray wild patch outside her high-rise apartment. I silently excused myself and recorded the call of this dainty medium-sized (10 cm) warbler on my phone.A few birds are fairly easy to spot, owing to their size, colour, and behaviour, but not this one, of the leaf-warbler species, the members of which are so similar in appearance it\u2019s difficult to differentiate one from the other: brightly coloured and slim in appearance.The timid behaviour of inhabiting the canopies of trees (where they feed on insects) and flittering around from branch to branch, often makes a skittish bird like the Greenish Warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) hard to spot through the thick foliage. The term Phylloscopus has been derived from the Greek words phullon meaning \u2018leaf\u2019 and skopos meaning \u2018seeker\u2019.The Greenish Warbler is one of the earliest migrants to travel from its breeding grounds in Europe to our region late in August, before moving further to South India in November, though a few stray birds do stick around until later. The bird has a pale greyish-olive plumage above and dull clean white breast, with a dusky grey wash to the sides. Like most arboreal warblers feeding in the canopy of trees, the Greenish Warbler has thin legs (dark in this species) unlike the stouter legs in other kinds of warblers that prefer to feed on ground. The spiky bill and reflexes help them catch insects in air. The species has a strong clearly marked head pattern with a long yellowish-white supercilium (eyebrow), prominent white ring around the eye, and a broad eyestripe. Typically, they have a short square-shaped tail and the wings have a single short, quite broad yellowish-white wingbar. Sometimes there is a second narrower wingbar difficult to see on the field. Both sexes are similar looking, and they\u2019re mostly found singly or in pairs. They mostly nest in shrubs, to avoid predatory attacks in high trees. Although found in a variety of habitats and altitudes, they are forest-dwellers. In the city, look for them in wooded areas: gardens with old dense trees, and places like Vasant Kunj, Saket, and North Campus.One way of identifying them is to look for fidgety birds that flick their wings and occasionally their tails. Another way, is to listen for the \u2018chee-wee\u2019.The writer is the founder of NINOX - Owl About Nature, a nature-awareness initiative.

Yet Qatar\u2019s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came to pay his respects, alongside an Emirati official, underscoring the late ruler\u2019s deft navigation of the region\u2019s stark political divides. The breadth and depth of emotion over the loss of Sheikh Sabah, known for his diplomacy and peacemaking, was reflected in condolence messages that streamed in from countries on opposite ends of regional feuds, from Saudi Arabia to Iran and Qatar. Calls for unitySheikh Nawaf took office as the new ruler of Kuwait in the Parliament building before rows of applauding lawmakers.\u201cKuwait throughout its history has seen serious and tough challenges, which we have succeeded in overcoming through cooperating together,\u201d said Sheikh Nawaf, reading from prepared remarks. \u201cToday, our dear country also faces risky circumstances and difficulties that there is no way to bypass except through unity.\u201d The challenges are manifold. Gridlock in Parliament has blocked the passage of a public debt law needed to raise $65 billion and mitigate the country\u2019s looming liquidity crisis. A major credit agency last week downgraded Kuwait for the first time in its history, citing the government\u2019s swelling budget deficit. Plunging oil prices amid the pandemic have robbed the wealthy country of cash."},

The principle of one country, two systems stands but again and again it\u2019s being undermined.\u201cWe will bring that up, as well as the poor and cruel treatment in part of the rights of the minorities in China.\u201d She did not name the minorities bearing the brunt of poor treatment but activists have accused China over the mass internment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.More than one million ethnic Uighurs and other minorities have been herded into internment camps to undergo political indoctrination, according to rights groups and experts.China insists the camps are training centres aimed at providing education to reduce the allure of Islamic radicalism.Beijing is also under fire over a security law it imposed on Hong Kong in June that radically increased its control over the financial hub and led to a brutal crackdown on dissent.Hong Kong was guaranteed autonomy under the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d deal agreed ahead of its 1997 handover from Britain.But critics say the security law, imposed following months of large and often violent protests calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability, spells the end of the agreement."},

This was caused primarily by Mr. Trump repeatedly talking over Mr. Biden, interrupting him and attempting to commandeer the debate from the moderator. During the debate, Mr. Trump failed to denounce White supremacists when provided an opportunity to do so and sought to undermine the legitimacy of the November elections, in which an unusually high number of Americans are expected to vote by mail, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When he was asked to condemn White supremacism and armed militias, specifically the Proud Boys \u2014 a group of men who call themselves \u201cwestern chauvinists\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump said, \u201cProud Boys, stand back and stand by! But I\u2019ll tell you what... somebody\u2019s got to do something about Antifa and the left.\u201d Members of the group celebrated the comment on social media.Mr. Trump repeatedly tried to throw Mr. Biden off balance, including by insinuating that Mr. Biden was controlled by the \u201cradical left\u201d or by bringing his son Hunter Biden \u2014 whose relationship with the government of Ukraine had been questioned by Republicans during the Trump impeachment hearings \u2014 into the discussion.\u2018Putin\u2019s puppy\u2019The debate had frequent acrimonious exchanges, with Mr. Biden visibly frustrated by Mr. Trump\u2019s interruptions.At one point,  Mr. Biden called Mr. Trump a \u201cclown\u201d and at another, said, \u201cWill you shut up, man?\u201d He also called Mr. Trump, \u201cPutin\u2019s puppy\u201d, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Biden\u2019s intelligence at one point. \u201cShow us your tax returns,\u201d Mr. Biden said when Mr. Trump was asked if he paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 as reported by the New York Times.Mr. Trump challenged Mr. Biden to say \u201claw and order\u201d. Mr. Biden said it but also said, \u201cwith justice where people are treated fairly\u201d. In recent months, the U.S. has witnessed mass protests set off by police killings and violence against African Americans. Some of these have been violent. Mr. Biden has supported the right to protests but has condemned the violence. Mr. Trump, keen to win the suburban women demographic, repeated a claim \u2014 one with racist undertones \u2014 that the Democrats under Mr. Biden were out to destroy suburbs. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t know a suburb unless he took a wrong turn,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThis is not 1950... all these dog whistles and racism don\u2019t work any more.\u201dMr. Trump, who has been making unsubstantiated claims on fraud around mail-in ballots, was asked by the debate moderator, Chris Wallace, if he would urge his supporters to stay calm and not engage in \u201ccivil unrest\u201d as the election was being decided. The President used the opportunity to once more cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election. He also urged poll-watchers to go into the polls and \u201cwatch very carefully\u201d, and said the Supreme Court would need to look at the ballots.\u201cI hope it\u2019s going to be a fair election. If it\u2019s a fair election, I am a 100% on board,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can\u2019t go along with that.\u201d There is no evidence of mail-in voting being a source of significant election fraud. Republican and Democrat-run States use the process and Mr. Trump has used it personally to cast his vote in the past.From time to time in the debate, Mr. Biden looked directly at the cameras and addressed the American public. He said Mr. Trump was trying to dissuade people from voting by scaring them into thinking their vote was not going to be legitimate.\u201cShow up and vote... you will determine the outcome of this election... He [Mr. Trump] cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election,\u201d he said.Mr. Biden said voters had the power to choose between changing the country or getting \u201cfour more years of these lies.\u201dComments on IndiaIndia received two mentions in the debate \u2014 along with U.S. rivals China and Russia.On India, China and Russia, Mr. Trump said the number of COVID-19 deaths was unknown because \u201cthey don\u2019t exactly give you a straight count\u201d.Mr. Trump clubbed India with Russia and China again during a segment on pollution. \u201cChina sends up real into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do.\u201d"},

However, the Centre stuck to its \u20b912 lakh crore borrowing plan for the year with the Finance Ministry exuding confidence that it would manage to meet its expenditure commitments within this plan.The Centre had already enhanced its borrowing target for the year by \u20b94.2 lakh crore to \u20b912 lakh crore in May this year as the initial adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the national lockdown became apparent.The government has borrowed \u20b97.66 lakh crore in the first half of the fiscal and plans to borrow the remaining \u20b94.34 lakh crore between October 2020 and January 2021, Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday.

Given that reconciliation with its key adversaries, China and Pakistan, is unlikely at this point and pursuing its ambitious territorial claims on the ground is almost impossible, New Delhi\u2019s continental options seem restricted to holding operations to prevent further territorial loss. Put differently, New Delhi\u2019s grand strategic plans in the continental space may have reached a dead end. State of  continental  strategy  The current state of India\u2019s continental strategies is hardly flattering. China has begun to push the boundaries with India, quite literally so, and Beijing is neither keen on ending the ongoing border stalemate nor reinstating the status quo with India as of March 2020. The peaceful India-China Line of Actual Control in the Northeast is now a thing of the past with China pushing back New Delhi\u2019s claims on Aksai Chin and New Delhi defending against Beijing\u2019s expansive territorial claims and their slow but aggressive implementation. China has crossed the red line with India and India\u2019s LAC  with China is not going to be the same ever again: It is the beginning of a long, bitter winter in the Himalayan borders between the two Asian giants. In the Northwest, the Pakistan front has also been heating up. Ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC) have spiked since last year as has the infiltration of terrorists across the LoC. With the change of the status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) by New Delhi in 2019, and Pakistan altering its political map a few months ago to include all of J&K, the India-Pakistan contestation over Kashmir has become fiercer. Equally important is the geopolitical collusion between Islamabad and Beijing to contain and pressure New Delhi from both sides. While this is not a new phenomenon, the intensity of the China-Pakistan  containment strategy against India today is unprecedented. The extent and intent behind this collusion will determine the future of the high stakes game in the Himalayas for a long time to come. Changes in AfghanistanThe ongoing  withdrawal of the United States from Afghanistan (the loss of a friend in the region for New Delhi, and the consequent reduction of India\u2019s influence in Afghanistan) and the return of the Taliban, with whom India has very little contact, could turn the geopolitical tide against New Delhi \u2014 similar to the situation in the early 1990s. But unlike in the 1990s, tables have turned in Afghanistan: the Taliban is no more an outcaste, and with the withdrawal of  forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from Afghanistan, the geopolitical interests of Pakistan, China and Russia would broadly converge in the region. The change of the geopolitical landscape in Afghanistan and the frictions in Iran-India relations will further dampen India\u2019s \u2018Mission Central Asia\u2019. In sum, this is perhaps the end of the road for New Delhi\u2019s north-eastern and north-western geopolitical forays. For sure, India needs to find a way out of this situation. One key part of the solution is to creatively deal with its continental dilemmas. To begin with, New Delhi must seek ways to break up the \u2018nutcracker situation\u2019 that the Pakistani and Chinese strategies have forced India into. To do so, India would need to deal with the comparatively easier part first \u2014 the Pakistan front. Pressure from the Pakistan front could be eased by addressing the Kashmir question with Islamabad. Creating a modicum of normalcy on the LoC by activating existing mechanisms such as the Director General of Military Operations (DGMO)  hotline is another way to deal with the Pakistan front. However, there is little appetite in New Delhi to do so. So, unless there is political will in New Delhi to put in place a strategy to address the Pakistan front, there will be little respite from the nutcracker situation that it faces today. And yet, it is time for New Delhi to think beyond its continental fixation. Maritime  strategy explained It appears abundantly clear now that New Delhi\u2019s excessive focus on the continental sphere since Independence has not yielded great returns in terms of secure borders, healthy relations with its neighbours or deterrence stability vis-\u00e0-vis adversaries. If so, it is time for India to change its grand strategic approach \u2014 by shifting its almost exclusive focus from the continental sphere to the maritime sphere. Clearly, New Delhi has already begun to think in this direction with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) establishing a new division to deal with the Indo-Pacific in April 2019. The work in this direction, both ideational and practical, needs to be fast-tracked to keep pace with the emerging realities and to make use of new opportunities. There are several reasons why a maritime grand strategy would work to India\u2019s advantage while still struggling with a continental dilemma. To begin with, unlike in the continental sphere where India seems to be hemmed in by China-Pakistan collusion, the maritime sphere is wide open to India to undertake coalition building, rule setting, and other forms of strategic exploration. Visualise this: while India seems stuck  between Pakistan and China from a continental perspective, the country is located right at the centre of the Indo-Pacific geopolitical imagination, in the midst of the oceanic space spanning \u201cfrom the shores of Africa to that of the Americas\u201d, as  Prime Minister Narendra Modi put it at the Shangri La Dialogue two years ago, on June 1, 2018 (https://bit.ly/30kdRHg). Second, unlike in the continental sphere, there is a growing great power interest in the maritime sphere, especially with the arrival of the concept of \u2018Indo-Pacific\u2019. The Euro-American interest in India\u2019s land borders with Pakistan and China is negligible, and more so, there is little any country can do to help India in its continental contestations. The situation in the maritime sphere is the exact opposite: great powers remain ever more interested in the maritime sphere and this interest has grown substantially since the coinage of Indo-Pacific. For instance, Germany recently released its Indo-Pacific guidelines following the example of France which brought out its Indo-Pacific strategy last year. Third, Beijing\u2019s bullying behaviour in the South China Sea in particular and the region in general has generated a great deal of willingness among the Euro-American powers and the countries of the region, including Australia and Japan, to push back Chinese unilateralism. This provides New Delhi with a unique opportunity to enhance its influence and potentially checkmate the Chinese ambitions in the region. Finally, the maritime space is a lot more important to China than engaging in opportunistic land grab attempts in the Himalayas, thanks to the massive Chinese trade that happens via the Oceanic routes and the complex geopolitics around the maritime  chokepoints which can potentially disrupt that trade. A revitalised Indian maritime grand strategy may or may not checkmate China in the Himalayas; it may even prompt Beijing to increase pressure there. But it will certainly provide New Delhi a lot more space for  manoeuvre in the region and message Beijing that  its Himalayan adventure could become costly for it. New Delhi must use its Indo-Pacific engagements to dissuade Beijing from salami-slicing Indian territory in the high Himalayas. Think beyond a  divisionTherefore, it is high time New Delhi shifted its almost exclusive focus from the  continental space to the maritime space, stitching together a maritime grand strategy. The MEA\u2019s Indo-Pacific Division is a good beginning; so is the decision in 2019 to elevate the Quad meetings among India, Japan, the United States and Australia to the ministerial level. New Delhi would do well to ideate on the current and future maritime challenges, consolidate its military and non-military tools, engage its strategic partners, and publish a comprehensive vision document on the Indo-Pacific; the current \u2018Indo-Pacific Division Briefs\u2019 document put out by the MEA does not make the cut. More so, New Delhi should consider appointing a special envoy for Indo-Pacific affairs.The Asian geopolitical chessboard awaits bold moves by New Delhi.Happymon Jacob is Associate Professor, Centre for International Politics, Organization and Disarmament, School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi"},

Sadly, the person who conceived this idea, Shinz\u014d Abe, has stepped down as the Prime Minister of Japan. Mr. Abe was a strategic thinker who thought beyond the limited timeframe of Japanese revolving-door politics. In 2007, the Quad (the United States, Japan, India, and Australia) was an idea whose time had not yet come. That was a different world.An evolutionThe global financial crisis was still lurking in the shadows as America continued to enjoy its \u2018unipolar moment\u2019. The American establishment still believed that it could, somehow, persuade China to become a \u2018responsible stake-holder\u2019 and, in any case, required Chinese goodwill in dealing with America\u2019s priorities \u2014 the nuclear issue with North Korea and Iran, and the War on Terror. Japan and Australia were riding the China Boom to prosperity. If India was ambivalent at the time, it was because this mirrored the uncertainties of others. China\u2019s shrill reaction to the idea of four like-minded countries establishing a plurilateral platform was, prima facie, intriguing. The idea was barely on the table; there was no clearly enunciated concept or proposed structures, much less joint understandings. The Chinese, however, labelled it as an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It became evident years later that the real reason for China\u2019s hyperreaction was out of concern that such a grouping would \u201cout\u201d China\u2019s plans for naval expansion by focusing on the Indo-Pacific maritime space. China was hoping that its naval build-up might slip under the radar because the Americans were distracted by continental challenges including Russia, Afghanistan and Iran, and would not look sea-ward. Once the idea of Quad 1.0 had died down, China gained in confidence to reveal its hand. It advanced a new claim \u2014  the Nine-Dash Line \u2014 in the South China Sea; it undertook the rapid kind of warship building activity reminiscent of Wilhelmine Germany before 1914; it  built its first overseas base in Djibouti; and it started systematically to explore the surface and sub-surface environment in the Indian Ocean beyond the Malacca Straits. This entire activity was coordinated by a  Central Leading Small Group for Protecting Maritime Rights and Interests, established in 2012. The manner of China\u2019s dismissal of the Arbitral Award in the dispute with the Philippines on the South China Sea and its brazen militarisation of the islands after its President had publicly pronounced to the contrary, has once again brought the four countries onto the same page and given a second chance to the Quad. A plurilateral mechanism The Chinese are skilled at obfuscation. They will, perhaps, endeavour to conflate the Quad with the Indo-Pacific vision, and link both to the so-called China Containment Theory. The Quad nations need to better explain that the Indo-Pacific Vision is an overarching framework that is being discussed in a transparent manner, with the objective of advancing everyone\u2019s economic and security interests. The Quad, on the other hand, is a plurilateral mechanism between countries that share interest on specific matters. There are other such mechanisms in the region. In 2016, China itself  established a Quadrilateral Cooperation and Coordination Mechanism with Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan and, more recently earlier this year, another one with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nepal. The Quad is no exception. The world today This time around, the four countries are navigating through more turbulent waters. The global pandemic and the faltering global economy are taking a toll on the region\u2019s growth and prosperity. The two major Pacific powers (China and America), are moving into a more adversarial phase of their relationship. Public opinion about China in all four countries is different from what it used to be in 2007. The fact of the meeting itself will signal to China that assertive or aggressive behaviour is not going to derail this mechanism. The forthcoming Ministerial meeting will be an opportunity to define the idea and chart a future path. Needless provocation of China should be avoided. There is no gain in actions that anger the Chinese with no commensurate benefit to the others. In a recent address to the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on August 31, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, Stephen Biegun, spoke about making sure that all the countries were moving at the same speed. This is an important statement because a plurilateral mechanism should also serve national interest. He also suggested that other countries might be invited to join in the future. This too is welcome; India has many other partners in the Indo-Pacific. Reaching outA positive agenda built around collective action in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, monitoring shipping for search  and rescue or anti-piracy operations, infrastructure assistance to climatically vulnerable states, connectivity initiatives and similar activities, will re-assure the littoral States that the Quad will be a factor for regional benefit, and a far cry from Chinese allegations that it is some sort of a military alliance.An outreach to the Indian Ocean littoral states is especially important since there are motivated reports from some quarters suggesting that India is, somehow, seeking to deny access, or to create infrastructure that impedes the legitimate movement of some extra-regional countries through the Indian Ocean. Prime Minister Abe had presciently said in the Central Hall of the Parliament of India on August 22, 2007 (https://bit.ly/2HFYS45) - \u201cA \u2018broader Asia\u2019 that broke away geographical boundaries is now beginning to take on a distinct form.\u201d It is the right time to realise Mr. Abe\u2019s dreams.
